    <p>The following are the controls for the motion planning demo:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>[r]</td>
                <td>Resets to the default simulation</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>[d]</td>
                <td>Toggles debug mode</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>[s]</td>
                <td>Place the location of the start point using the mouse</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>[e]</td>
                <td>Place the location of the end point using the mouse</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>[o]</td>
                <td>Place the another obstacle using the mouse</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>[space]</td>
                <td>Pause/resume the simulation</td>

    <h3>Motion Planning</h3>
    <p>The motion planning demo below is implemented using a PRM. It is rendered in 3D and the agent has extent. The agent also performs path smoothing, which can be better seen in the later demos. </p>

    <h3>Using Interaction</h3>
    <p>The start and end positions can be set at runtime. Additionaly obstacles can be added by using the mouse.</p>

    <h3>Path Visualization</h3>
    <p>The underlying PRM can be visualized by activating the debug mode. The path smoothing can be easily seen in this example.</p>

    <p>I used <a href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/50_SDL_and_opengl_2/index.php">this tutorial</a> in order to setup OpenGL with SDL. Much of the OpenGL boiler plate was adapted from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/samplecode/GLEssentials/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010104">Apple's OpenGL sample project</a>. The math library that I developed uses much of the code provided in this sample project.</p>

    <p>Also I found the texture I am using for the wood texture <a href="http://www.fbcabbeville.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/textures-wallpapers-free-wood-texture-grunge-wood.jpg">here</a>. </p>

    <p>The only two frameworks that I use in this project at SDL and SDL_Image (in order to load the textures). I coded everything else. This includes the scene graph, tessellation of various primitives, as well as wrappers classes for OpenGL.</p>
