    <p>The following are the controls for the crowd simulation demo:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>[1-4]</td>
                <td>Shows various crowd simulation demos</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>[space]</td>
                <td>Pause/resume the simulation</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    <h3>Crowd Simulation</h3>
    <p>All of the crowd simulation demos are using Helbing's social forces. The agents and obstacles are rendered in 3D. </p>

    <h3>Local Minima</h3>
    <p>The simulation is also able to navigate through environments with local minima. This is done by make the agents follow paths generated using a PRM and A*.</p>

    <h3>Simulation Breakdown</h3>
    <p>There are situations when the simulation breaks down. For example, one of the agents in this simulation is pushed backward, so it ends up doing unnecessary backtracking. </p>

    <p>I used <a href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/50_SDL_and_opengl_2/index.php">this tutorial</a> in order to setup OpenGL with SDL. Much of the OpenGL boiler plate was adapted from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/samplecode/GLEssentials/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010104">Apple's OpenGL sample project</a>. The math library that I developed uses much of the code provided in this sample project.</p>

    <p>Also I found the texture I am using for the wood texture <a href="http://www.fbcabbeville.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/textures-wallpapers-free-wood-texture-grunge-wood.jpg">here</a>. </p>

    <p>The only two frameworks that I use in this project at SDL and SDL_Image (in order to load the textures). I coded everything else. This includes the scene graph, tessellation of various primitives, as well as wrappers classes for OpenGL.</p>
